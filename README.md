# weather-dashboard
this will let you search for cities and get the weather and a five day forecast, also clear search history, and also keeps a list of your searches that will bring the data back from the list without having to search for the city again. I messed around with trying to get current location so that when you open the page it would ask you to share location and would automatically bring up that weather but it got confusing so I dropped it. The only real hard part was changing the weather F and MPH and getting data from the UV api, luckily with bootstrap I did not have to do much CSS work either.
